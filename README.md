# ScratchDraw


scratchDraw is a basic drawing app  that includes the ability to free-draw , make lines, and create shapes (triangle , rectangle, ellipse right now). 8 different drawing colors can be selected from.

TO DO: currently UI is a rudimentary placeholder. A new design with a pop up/hideable menu will be implemented.
